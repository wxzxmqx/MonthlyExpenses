# MonthlyExpenses

This is a basic expense tracker written in Python. It allows users to:
- ✅ Add expenses 💸
- ✅ Calculate the total sum of all expenses 📊
- ✅ Exit the program safely 🚪

## How It Works
- The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to quit.
- Expenses are stored in a list (not saved after exiting).
- Simple input validation is included to prevent errors.

## Usage
1️⃣ Run the script.
2️⃣ Select an option from the menu.
3️⃣ Enter expense amounts and track your total spending.

📌 **Future improvements** could include saving expenses to a file, categorizing them, or adding a graphical interface.
