# MonthlyExpenses

This is a basic expense tracker written in Python. It allows users to:
- âœ… Add expenses ðŸ’¸
- âœ… Calculate the total sum of all expenses ðŸ“Š
- âœ… Exit the program safely ðŸšª

## How It Works
- The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to quit.
- Expenses are stored in a list (not saved after exiting).
- Simple input validation is included to prevent errors.

ðŸ“Œ **Future improvements** could include saving expenses to a file, categorizing them, or adding a graphical interface.
